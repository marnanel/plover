About
-----
Plover (rhymes with "lover") is a desktop application that allows anyone to use stenography to write on their computer, up to speeds of 200WPM and beyond.

Plover is part of the `Open Steno Project`_. The Open Steno Project's goal is to provide everything you need to learn machine shorthand on your own, from free software, to cheap hardware, to learning resources.

Plover is GPLv2+ as of version 3.1.0. See `LICENSE.txt`_ for details.

Installation
------------
Plover runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

View the `installation guide`_ which covers downloading, installation, and initial configuration.

Programming
***********

If Python isn't your thing, there are other steno-related projects, including StenoJig_ (JavaScript) and StenoTray_ (Java).

Writing, Art, UX, and Web Design
********************************

- The Plover Wiki_ discusses Plover and Open Steno in general. Edits to the Wiki and new page ideas are welcome.
- Graphic art for Plover and stenography in general is always appreciated. The app's icons are worked on at `morinted/plover_icons`_. You may consider reimagining or reposing Plover's mascot, Dolores_.
- UX improvement suggestions are welcome. Plover runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and should be powerful but out of the way, which poses some interesting challenges. Please drop in to the Discord server to brainstorm with users and the developers.
- Open Steno has websites that accept contributions, including the `Open Steno Project homepage`_  and `Plover's homepage`_.
